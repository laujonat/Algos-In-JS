Four Billion

Problem Statement:

You have been given an input file with four billion longs, provide an algorithm to generate an long which is not contained in the file. We are considering long as 32 bit unsigned longs. Assume you have 1 GiB memory. Follow up with what you would do if you have only 10 MiB of memory.

Note: Actually it is not possible to provide 4 billion longs in input, so your solution should be for 4 billion longs, but in input, we will test it with only <= 2 * 10^5 longs.

Input/Output Format For The Function:
Input Format:
The function contains a single argument, a long array arr.
Output Format:
Return a long which is not present among the given n longs.

Input Format:
First line contains long n, the number of longs. The next n lines contains a long each.

If arr = {1,3,5,7} then input should be:
4
1
3
5
7
Output Format:

Output in a single line a long not present among the given longs.

For input arr = {1,3,5,7}, output can be any long from the given set {0,2,4,6,8,9.,4000000000}. Here lets consider it to be 2.
2
