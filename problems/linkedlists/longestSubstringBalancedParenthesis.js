/*
Longest Substring With Balanced Parentheses

Given a string brackets that may only contain characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest substring that has balanced parentheses.

A string is defined as having balanced parentheses if and only if it has an equal number of '(' and ')' and its every prefix has at least as many '('s as ')'s.

Return the length, not the substring.

Example One

Input: "((((())(((()"

Output: 4
Because "(())" is the longest substring with balanced parentheses.

Example Two
Input: "()()()"

Output: 6
The entire string "()()()" has parentheses balanced.

Notes
Input Parameters: Function has one argument: string brackets.

Output: Function must return an integer value.
Constraints:
1 <= length of brackets <= 10^5
