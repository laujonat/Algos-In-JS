/*
Given A Graph, Build A New One With Reversed Edges
Given a strongly connected directed graph, build a new graph with the same number of nodes but every edge reversed. This is also called transposing a graph.
Example
Input: 
  Any node of this graph:
Output: 
  Any node of the new:

Notes
Input Parameters: 
  Function has one argument pointing to a node of the given graph.
Output: 
  Return any node of the new graph.
Constraints:
  1 <= number of nodes <= 315
  Value in any node will be a unique integer between 1 and number of nodes, inclusive.
  No multiple edges (connecting any pair of nodes in one direction) or self loops (edges connecting a node with itself) in the input graph.
  You are not allowed to modify the given graph. Return a newly built graph.
