/*
Shortest Word Edit Path
Given two words source and target, and a list of words words, find the length of the shortest series of edits that transforms source to target.

Each edit must change exactly one letter at a time, and each intermediate word (and the final target word) must exist in words.

If the task is impossible, return -1.

Examples:

source = "bit", target = "dog"
words = ["but", "put", "big", "pot", "pog", "dog", "lot"]

output: 5
explanation: bit -> but -> put -> pot -> pog -> dog has 5 transitions.
source = "no", target = "go"
words = ["to"]

output: -1
Constraints:

[time limit] 5000ms
[input] string source
1 ≤ source.length ≤ 20
[input] string target
1 ≤ target.length ≤ 20
[input] array.string words
1 ≤ words.length ≤ 20
[output] array.integer
