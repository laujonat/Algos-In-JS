/*
Nearest Neighbours



Problem Statement:



Given a point p, and other n points in two-dimensional space, find k points out of n points which are nearest to p.

NOTE: Distance between two points is measured by the standard Euclidean method.



Input/Output Format For The Function:

Input Format:

There are 4 arguments in input, an integer p_x, which is the x coordinate of point p, integer p_y, which is the y coordinate of point p, an integer k and a 2D integer array of points n_points.

Output Format:
Return a 2D integer array result, which contains k points, nearest to point p.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100000
-1000000000 <= coordinates of the points <=1000000000
k <= total number of points in array points.
