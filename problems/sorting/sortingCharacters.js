/*
Sort All Characters


Problem Statement:

You have to sort an array of characters containing alphanumeric characters along with some other characters - ‘!’, ’@’, ’#’, ’$’, ’%’, ’^’, ’&’, ’*’, ’(‘, ’)’. You are given a character array named arr.

Input/Output Format For The Function:

Input Format:
There is only one argument in input, a character array named arr.

Output Format:
Return a character array result, containing characters in sorted order of their ASCII values. You can overwrite the existing array.

Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:

Input Format:
The first line contains the size, n, of the character array. Next n lines each contain the characters present in the array, with each character of the array in a new line.

If arr = {a,z,i,#,&,l,c} then input should be:
7
a
z
i
#
&
l
c

Output Format:
Output each character of the array on a new line, in sorted order of their ASCII values.

For above input - arr = {a,z,i,#,&,l,c}, output will be:
#
&
a
c
i
l
z
Constraints:

1 <= length(arr) <= 100000
