/*
  BST Successor Search
    In a Binary Search Tree (BST), an Inorder Successor of a node is defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node (see examples below). 
    Given a node inputNode in a BST, youâ€™re asked to write a function findInOrderSuccessor that returns the Inorder Successor of inputNode. If inputNode has no Inorder Successor, return null.

    Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.
